      "He pictures them boarding the ship to soft-spoken expressions of admiration from the crew, paddling out through the pirate���s passage, and letting the wind send them freely skimming over the seas.\n",
      "He stills this vision in the most perfect of settings: an orange sky, just shy of dusk; a sturdy warm breeze filling the sails; their wake whitening to the water behind them, ever and always marking where they have been but need never go again.\n",
      "He knows this, somehow, knows that it is folly to pretend they are safe, that they are anything but doomed.\n",

      "The physics of sound cooperates, finally, and when the sound of the cocked hammer reaches S.���s ears, he knows precisely where the sound came from.\n",
      "His advantage will be in his speed, in his ferocity, in his absolute need to find her.\n",
      "It clatters across the floor, a surface of smooth, polished stone.\n",
